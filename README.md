# Rectangles

## Design

The application operates in 2 stages.

- Read a list of rectangles from the input file.
- Calculate the results from the built list of rectangles.
- Write the output.

## Building

To build all the targets, run make from the root of the source tree.

## Running

Two targets are generated by the build process:

### rectangles

This is the main output of the program and can be called like this:

```
rectangles <input file> [<output file>]
```

Specify the input file as the first parameter.  When no output file is specified in the second parameter, the output will print out to the console.  Otherwise the output will be written into the output file.

### rect_test

Runs some unit tests for the Rect class.

## Further Development

- The application required a lot more unit tests.  The string parsing and file reading especially.
